# JDOS

This is a DDOS program, fully written in Java.

## Note

This program is only for educational purposes!
You use this on your own risk. 
Distributed Denial of Service attacks are illegal, you could go to jail for this.


## Installation

1. Download and install Java (I won´t write an instruction for this)
2. Download and install Netbeans: https://netbeans.org/downloads/
3. Download my project and import it in Netbeans (File -> Open project)
4. Code and have fun


## Usage

After you have installed Netbeans etc. you can click on "Clean and Build Project" on the top of netbeans.
After that you can find .jar file in your workspace "dist" folder.

Start this .jar file and you can see the interface.

## History

Since i am doing a Higher Technical College for Information Technologies in Austria, I thought
i want to do something cool and not just the same boring school stuff every day.

So i decided to make my own DDOS program (for educational purposes only).
At first i didn´t want to publish that, but now i think "why not".

So here we are.
